All primitive data types and operations are the same as C++


PRINT STATEMENTS
there are subtle differences in the print statements:

System.out.println(); // prints whatever is in the () with a newline at the end
System.out.printf(); // only prints strings???
System.out.printf(); // is able to print numbers


USER INPUT
import java.util.Scanner; // need this header
Scanner cin = new Scanner(System.in); // cin becomes an instant of the class Scanner???


Below are diff examples
dataType value;

value = cin.next(); //reads in string. spaces will terminate string 
value = cin.nextDouble();// reads Double
//replace 'Double' with any other numeral dataType ie: Int, Float
